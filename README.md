# Stylize  

**Stylize Website**

Stylize is a web application which allows users to upload images of clothing items, and the website will return a list of places where the clothing item can be bought. Stylize allows users to add items to their favourites, share their matches on social media, and see what is trending!

To run Stylize:
Make sure packages are installed:  npm install

In the frontend folder: npm start

For this sprint, the account sign up feature is in a separate github due to firebase issues. This will be fixed in Sprint 2.
Therefore, the login and signup buttons will take you to the home page so you will be able to access it. Normally, these buttons will take you to what you will find in the other repository.
