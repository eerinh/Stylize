# Stylize  

**Stylize Website**

Stylize is a web application which allows users to upload images of clothing items, and the website will return a list of places where the clothing item can be bought. Stylize allows users to add items to their favourites, share their matches on social media, and see what is trending!

To run Stylize, Use the Main Branch:
Make sure packages are installed:  npm install

In the frontend folder: npm start

For this sprint, the account sign up feature is in a separate github due to firebase issues. This will be fixed in Sprint 2.
Therefore, the login and signup buttons will take you to the home page so you will be able to access it. Normally, these buttons will take you to what you will find in the other repository.

**Github Account Feature:** https://github.com/s0sanp/login-trial.git

The Account sign in and log in feature in a separate folder due to firebase issues.

When testing the login and signup features in this seperate repo, the component will start off as a blank page but in the url tab ensure to /login or /signup and after that all functionality should work. This issue will be resolved in sprint 2. An example of this is inserted as an image below: ![image](https://github.com/eerinh/Stylize/assets/91291065/58c83eb5-d8bd-42b2-8dee-b4493a87fd10)


Otherwise in the URL tab:

http://localhost:3000

it would appear like ^^ just /login at the end of the 3000 like shown below otherwise, refer to the image.

http://localhost:3000/signup
